<body><h1>Resources</h1>

<p>A resource is a static file type, such as an image that makes up part of the application. 
Typically, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript, XSL stylesheets and images are attached as resources. 
A resource may be any file type.

<h1>Documentation</h1>

<p>The documentation section is not accessible from any URL, it may only be viewed through 
the webdesign application. This provides an area within the application to attach notes and 
information to other programmers that may help with the maintenance of the application. 
Documentation may be any type of file (MS-Word, Text file, PDF, images).

<p>We have taken great care to ensure a Puakma web application is a self-sustaining container 
of both application design and documentation.
