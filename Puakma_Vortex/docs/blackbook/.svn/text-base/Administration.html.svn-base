<body><h1>The Administration Interface</h1>

<p>The server may be controlled with a web browser. An administration application 
is included to make the process of managing and monitoring your Puakma server very 
easy. The administration application may be found here: http://your_server/system/admin.pma 
Remember that you will be prompted for a username and password. This will initially be 
sysadmin, with the password allocated during the install process.

<p>Informational messages are displayed with a blue spot, errors in red and debug messages 
in yellow. This makes it very easy to troubleshoot problems.

<p>Remote access to the server console is also provided through the web browser interface.
