<body><h1>Actions</h1>
<p>Actions perform the logic or data processing of the application. Actions may be invoked in three ways:
<ol>
<li>Directly from a URL, eg: http://servername/group/app.pma/ActionName?OpenAction
<li>When a particular page is opened
<li>When a particular page is submitted
</ol>

<p>Actions are simple Java classes that extend ActionRunner. A simple Action that prints “Hello, world!” 
to the browser follows:

<pre>
import puakma.system.*;

/**
 * A simple Puakma action template.
 */
public class SimpleAction extends ActionRunner
{
  public String execute()
  {
    this.writeln(“Hello, world!”);
    return ""; //no redirect!
  }
}
</pre>

<h2>Global Actions</h2>
<p>Global Actions are defined as part of the Application Settings section. A global OpenAction 
is run every time a Page or Action is called. There may be multiple Global Actions which are run 
sequentially. The first action to output some value halts the chain processing the response from 
that Action is sent to the browser.

<p>Global Actions are great for either prefilling fields on a Page (such as menu items, user names 
and the like) or controlling complex security. By placing all your application access logic in one 
place it makes it very easy to control who has access to which portions of the application without 
peppering the application logic with security checks.

<h2>Scheduled Actions</h2>
<p>Scheduled Actions have identical code to a regular Action, but they are not able to output to 
a browser. Scheduled Actions are run by the AGENDA server task at the time defined by the Scheduled 
Action’s settings in the webdesigner application.

<p>A great way to test a scheduled action during development is to save it into the design collection 
as a regular action. This way the developer needs only to open the URL for the action for the action 
logic to be executed.
