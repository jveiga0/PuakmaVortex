<body><h1>Session Authentication</h1>

<p>Each user of the server has a Session object that describes their session. This 
is available within Actions as the object “pSession”. The session object is very powerful, 
containing many methods for work with or determining user credentials. Additionally, ad hoc 
objects may be stored on the session object providing a volatile storage area for data that 
needs to persist for the duration of the session.

<p>The session is maintained in the web browser using a session token. When a user 
first connects to the Puakma server, a token is allocated which the browser sends 
to the server with each subsequent request. Web browsers must support cookies in order 
to use Puakma.

<p>Tornado Server  supports the Authorization: http header. This allows applications 
such as web services to authenticate with the server with their credentials.

<p>Sessions exist on the server until there has been no activity for the specified 
server-wide session timeout interval.

<p>A Tornado server generates Ltpa tokens that may also be used for single sign-on 
against Lotus Domino servers.
