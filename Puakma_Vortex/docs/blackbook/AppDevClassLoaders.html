<body><h1>Class Loaders</h1>
<p>Tornado Server has two class loaders. The first is created when the server is started and 
its main job is to simplify the classpath. It actually serves two purposes, first files need 
only be copied to directories to be available to the class loader (eg /lib/) and secondly it 
allows new code to be loaded on a server restart without exiting the JVM. Allowing new code 
to be loaded on a server restart means that overall downtime due to an upgrade is minimized 
since the administrator can simply copy and prepare all files, then restart the server. 
The second classloader (SharedActionClassLoader) is responsible for retrieving application 
specific class data from the database.

<h2>SharedActionClassLoader</h2>
<p>This classloader performs the bulk of the work. There is one of these classloaders created 
for each .pma application and one for Actions, Shared Actions and Business Widgets. 

<p>When an action is run or widget loaded, the class loader must determine the real class name 
of the action as it may be different to its name in the design collection. Next it must determine 
what libraries are to be used with this action (AlwaysLoad or action specific UseLibrary). All 
these items are added to an internal cache so the action is typically slow to load the first 
time it is run, then loads very quickly afterward.

<p>The classloader's cache must be purged and the classloader dropped when a design element is 
changed. This is to ensure subsequent actions correctly pick up the new code. This also means 
that any stored session objects (pSession.addSessionObject(); ) must be removed because the server 
is unable to guarantee that the object stored on the session is still valid or that a library it 
relies on is available. Further, when sessions are saved to disk on a server restart (eg "restart 
server save" or "quit save" at the console), any objects loaded with this classloader are discarded.

<p>This classloader should not be used directly by the programmer, we have included information 
here merely to give developers an understanding of its operation.
