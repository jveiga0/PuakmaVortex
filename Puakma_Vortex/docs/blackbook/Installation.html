<body><h1>Installation</h1>

<p>Installing Tornado Server is simple, before you start, make sure you have the following:

<ol>
	<li>Downloaded a copy of the Sun JRE or JDK version 1.4.2 or greater (see: 
	<a href="http://java.sun.com/">http://java.sun.com/</a>) and installer from 
	<a href="http://www.puakma.net">http://www.puakma.net</a>
	<li>Two minutes free for the installation ;-)</li>
</ol>

<p>For the purpose of this install process, it is assumed that Microsoft Windows NT is 
the operating system with the database server on the same machine. The basic techniques
used here should easily translate across to other operating systems, database servers 
and hardware platforms. 

<h2>Architecture and hardware configuration</h2>
<p>The design of Puakma is such that almost any hardware/server configuration may be used. 
You may have your database servers clustered and behind a firewall, with Puakma sitting out 
front. You can even have multiple Puakma servers utilising the same data source. This allows 
you to, say, run a HTTP server on two machines, while using yet another for scheduled 
processing and mail. You are also able to run a multiple copies of Puakma on the same 
machine. The possible configurations are almost endless. Various architectures will be 
discussed later.

<h2>1. Installing the JDK/JRE</h2>
<p>Go to the Sun website and download the latest JDK (Java Development Kit). The JDK 
is for developers and includes the JRE (You can install just the JRE, but the full SDK 
is recommended). Please follow Sun's install instructions. When the install has completed, 
type java -version at the command prompt. You should see something like the following:

<pre>C:>java -version
java version "1.4.0"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.0-b92)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.0-b92, mixed mode)
</pre>

<p>Tornado Server requires 1.4.0 or greater JDK.

<h2>2. Installing Tornado Server</h2>
<p>Locate TornadoServerInstall.jar and double-click to execute the installation. This file is a self-launching Java application and should work on all GUI platforms. Sometimes .jar files are not associated correctly with Java applications and they will not automatically launch on some machines. If this occurs, open a command shell and type “java –jar TornadoServerInstall.jar” in the folder that contains TornadoServerInstall.jar.

<p>Next follow the installation screens and input your installation choices.

<p>Puakma contains an embedded database called HSQLDB. This is loaded automatically when the server is started and means that you do not need to worry about setting up a database server. If you decide that you would rather use mySQL, PostgreSQL or other RDBMS, then this may be configured. The database setup scripts for other databases are included in the /config/ folder and are named datadef.xxxx (eg datadef.mysql for mySQL). Set up the database as per the vendor’s instructions and run the appropriate configuration script to create the Puakma system tables. Next copy the vendor’s jdbc driver to /jdbc/, and then update puakma.config with the database connection strings (eg SystemDBURL and SystemDriverClass etc).

<p>Finally, to start Puakma, run pmaStart.bat. You should see screen output similar to the following:

</pre>

<p>The first server startup may be slightly slower than normal since the HSQLDB task will create the system database and tables, then populate this with the design data and login information for SysAdmin. Please check the startup screen carefully for any error messages (E).

<p>At the server console you can execute a variety of commands. Type a ? then enter to get help. You can also 'tell' tasks to do things. eg, tell HTTP cache status

<p>As you can see from the screen above, the configuration for your server is held in /puakma/config/puakma.config Edit this file with your favourite text editor to change your server's behaviour.

<p>Next start your web browser and type the hostname (or localhost if you are on the same machine) into the browser's address bar. Enter the SysAdmin username and the password you entered during the install process. We recommend you create a new user and add them to the Admin group, and delete the default SysAdmin account.

<p>People and groups, logs and server console may be administered from http://your_server/system/admin.pma 
Web applications can be created and edited from http://your_server/system/webdesign.pma 

<p>If your server does not have a GUI console, the installation can be run on any machine with a GUI console, then the resulting files copied to the non-GUI machine.
