<body><h1>Security</h1>
<p>The application server takes care of application security. By configuring roles 
in the web application the server is able to determine which users may access which 
resources. Checking of these roles is delegated to an “Authenticator” which allows 
security to be handled in the same way for all applications residing on the server. 
Developers may create their own customer authenticators to handle logging in against 
many different kinds of data sources. An application may handle its own security and 
login process, but it is recommended to delegate this to the authentication subsystem, 
since this makes the application more portable between environments.

<p>Tornado Server uses a role-based security model. Developers create roles specific 
to the application and then associate individual names or groups to those roles. When
 a name or group is assigned a role, that is referred to as a permission.

<p>There is a special role named "AllowAccess". This role is checked automatically by 
the server when an application user attempts to access a design element within the design 
collection. A setting of "*" allows all users basic access to the design elements 
of the application. When you create a new application, an "AllowAcces" and an "Admin" 
role are created automatically. 

<p>"WebServiceAccess" controls who may call web services.

<p>"ResourceAccess" controls which users without the "AllowAccess" role can access resources. 
This is useful for applications that don’t allow anonymous access but have their own internal 
login page (that references resources in the same application).

<p>Permissions may be specified in a number of ways:
<ul>
<li>A person’s full X500 name, eg: "John Smith/Sales/AcmeCorp"</li>
<li>A group name, eg: "All Sales Staff"</li>
<li>A wildcard name, eg "*/Sales/AcmeCorp"</li>
<li>* meaning anyone including anonymous users</li>
<li>!* anyone except anonymous users (users must be authenticated)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, multiple permissions may be assigned to each role. Permissions are not granular, 
if a user's name matches one of the permissions, they have the role. It is then up 
to the developer’s code to determine what may be done based on that permission. To check roles 
in the Action java code:

<pre>if(pSession.hasRole("DocumentCreator")) {
	//perform the specific logic
}
</pre>

<p>A useful way of handling security is to utilize a “Global Action” that does role and permission 
checking in a central spot, outside of the main application logic. The advantage of this approach 
is that all security rules are in one place and all design elements are catered for. This also 
means the developer can code the security rules after the bulk of the application has been 
developed. Following is a sample security Global Action.


<pre>
import puakma.system.*;

/**
 * Called for every page automatically to ensure the correct security is applied. 
 */
public class GlobalSecurity extends ActionRunner
{
  public String execute()
  {
    String LOGIN_PAGE="Login";

    //If anonymous user, plug to the Login Page.
    if(pSession.getUserName().equals(pmaSession.ANONYMOUS_USER)) {
      if(ActionDocument.designObject.getDesignName().equalsIgnoreCase(LOGIN_PAGE))
        return "";
      return ActionDocument.rPath.getFullPath() + "&login";
    }

    RequestPath rpPage = ActionDocument.rPath;
    String sPage = ActionDocument.rPath.szDesignElement;

    //admin has access to everything
    if(pSession.hasUserRole("Admin"))
      return "";
      
    //if we get to here, we’re not an admin so check each page   
    if(sPage.equalsIgnoreCase("Administration"))
      return getDBURL()+ "/Unavailable?OpenPage";

    //add more page and role checks here

    return “”;
  }
}//end class
