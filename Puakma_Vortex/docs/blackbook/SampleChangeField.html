<body><h1>Changing field types</h1>
<p>One of the major advantages of p-tags is the ability to change them in an action. For example, under certain conditions perhaps a list box should be removed from the page, or replaced with computed text.

<p>In this example a listbox of project managers is replaced with some plain text:
<pre>&lt;P@List name="ProjectManagerList" size="10" @P&gt;</pre>

<pre>HTMLDocumentItem hdi = ActionDocument.getHTMLDocumentItem("ProjectManagerList");
hdi.setType(HTMLDocumentItem.ITEM_TYPE_COMPUTED);
ActionDocument.setItemValue("ProjectManagerList ", "ALL PROJECT MANAGERS ARE ASSIGNED");
</pre>

<p>Note: This technique illustrated here does not work with dynamically created fields. For 
dynamically created fields, the programmer must keep a handle to the dynamic object and manipulate 
that object.
