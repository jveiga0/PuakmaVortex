<body><h1>Extending the server with AddIn tasks</h1>
<p>Puakma can be easily extended by writing AddIn tasks that are loaded as part of the server startup. 
An AddIn task may perform any function, some examples of tasks that are shipped as part of the core 
product are HTTP, BOOSTER, AGENDA, WIDGIE, MAILER, â€¦ 

<p>AddIns may be packaged as class files or packaged into a .jar file. It is recommended that you 
place your own addins in the /addins/ folder. By placing jars or classes here, they will be automatically 
added to the classpath.

<p>The authoring of an AddIn is beyond the scope of this blackbook. For a basic example, please see 
the SampleAddIn.java file in the /addins/ folder.
