<body><h1>PMX files for moving applications between servers</h1>
<p>Puakma provides a simple mechanism for moving web applications between servers. This may 
be useful when an application is moved from the development server to the production server, 
or simply to send to customers to evaluate.

<p>A PMX file (PuakMa eXport) is a compressed XML file that contains the application design 
information flattened into a single file. PMX files are generally very small (<500Kb) and easy 
to email or provide as a download from a website.

<p>To create a pmx file of an existing application:
<ol>
<li>Open the webdesign application http://your_server/system/webdesign.pma </li>
<li>Click on the application to export</li>
<li>From designerâ€™s menu, select File > Export</li>
<li>You will be prompted to save a file. Save the file to your local disk. This file is the pmx.</li>
</ol>
