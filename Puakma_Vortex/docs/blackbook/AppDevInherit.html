<body><h1>Inheriting Design Elements</h1>
<p>Puakma supports design templates. This means developers may have multiple instances 
of an application on a Puakma server, with each instance set to get its design from 
a template. Each morning at 4am, the RefreshDesign Scheduled Action (inside /system/webdesign.pma) 
checks the template against the applications that inherit from it and make the appropriate changes, 
such as adding new elements or updating actions that have changed.

<p>An example of where this may be useful is if your server contains five discussion forum applications 
all sharing an identical design. By updating the master template, all discussion forums will have their 
design altered to match the master template the next time the RefreshDesign scheduled action is run.
