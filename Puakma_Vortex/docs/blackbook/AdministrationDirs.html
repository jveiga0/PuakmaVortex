<body><h1>Directories structure</h1>

<p>Tornado directories structure is inspired by unix filesystem. So there is 
a root directory which doesn't contain anything, and couple of subdirectories 
containing all necessary files structured in clear way.

<h2>addins</h2>

<p>Contains Tornado addins. Those addins are some java binaries which might be
loaded to the server, and there might live it's own life. You can think about 
addins as plugins for Tornado server. Addins live in the same classloader as
Tornado server.

<h2>bin</h2>

<p>Contains Tornado binaries, and some startup scripts.

<h2>config</h2>

<p>Contains configuration files

<h3>puakma.config</h3>

<p>Tornado main configuration file. This <a 
href="AdministrationPuakmaConf.html">document</a> describes content of this file.

<h3>datadef.*</h3>

<p>These files contain SQL definition of Tornado system database for various
RMDB systems. Nowadays we have scripts for HSQLDB, Mysql, Postgre, and Oracle. 
File datadef.sql is generic definition of SQL for Tornado system database. Feel
free to modify this definition according to you database system.

<h2>doc</h2>

<p>This directory contains some documentation. This documentation is not accessible
from the HTTP server, but only on local machine. It contains javadoc for Tornado
server since it is not practical to load javadoc from HTTP server.

<h2>html_public</h2>

<p>Directory that contains files that are publicly accessible by HTTP server.
There should be files that needs some directory structure as JavaScript libraries,
etc...

<h2>jdbc</h2>

<p>This directory contains jar files with jdbc drivers for database connection.
Those drivers live in the same classloader as Tornado server.

<h2>lib</h2>

<p>This directory contains java libraries loaded to the server at the startup.
These libraries live in the tornado server classloader, not in the application
classloaders.

<p>See also <a href="AppDevClassLoaders.html">application classloaders</a>

<h2>logs</h2>

<p>This directory contains access logs, and error logs. 

<h1>TODO: write something about log rotating etc...</h1>

<h2>temp</h2>

<p>This is temporary directory for the files used by Tornado server, and applications 
on the Tornado server.

<h2>tornado_installer</h2>
