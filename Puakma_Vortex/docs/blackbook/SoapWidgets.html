<body><h1>Business Widgets</h1>
<p>Puakma web services are based on SOAP and required the Enterprise Edition to be installed 
in order to run (the require the WIDGIE server task). Puakma web services are possibly 
the easiest way of creating and publishing web services. To create a Business Widget web 
service, create a Java class that extends BusinessWidget.

<pre>import puakma.addin.widgie.*;

/**
 * A sample web service 
 */
public class HelloWorld extends BusinessWidget
{
    public String sayHello()
    {
    	return “Hello, world!”;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Once the code has been compiled and attached as a Business Widget, it will be automatically 
loaded and mounted within the application, ready for use. There are no complicated WSDL interfaces 
to write or configure. Business Widgets are run in their own thread so may also store their own data 
that persists between calls to the service.
