<body><h1>Anatomy of a Web Application</h1>
<p>All application design data is stored in a relational database, as part of the “Puakma” 
system database. The main advantage of storing application design information in a database 
is the ability to store metadata along with it. Although many web platforms simply store 
files on the filesystem, storing them in a relational database creates the possibility to 
manipulate them programmatically and do simple yet powerful queries to update, interrogate 
or view many facets of the application, even create new elements dynamically.

<p>Tornado Server web applications have the “.pma” (PuakMa Application) URL extention, eg: 
http://www.server.com/system/admin.pma . As the entire design is served from a relational 
database, the URL maybe somewhat confusing, because humans naturally associate a URL with 
a file path. In the case of Puakma, the URL is a reference to a set of design data stored 
in the database. A single server can hold many of these applications and run them all 
simultaneously.

<p>Application specific data is stored separately to the design information. The database 
connection records within the application provide a simple way to reference the data storage 
area. It is incredibly easy to point your application at an existing data store, or to have 
multiple applications referencing the same datastore.

<p>A Tornado Server application is a complete application package. It contains all design 
elements and security information required to move the application between server instances. 
The way the framework is designed allows for applications to be self-documenting, which make 
supporting a Puakma application much easier. Developers use their web browsers to create 
and work with web applications. The web design application can be found at 
http://your_server/system/webdesign.pma All the source code is included with the webdesign 
application so developers can modify or extend the base version to include new features 
(for example “check-in/check-out”)

<p>Web applications may be moved easily from server to server through by exporting them to 
a single “.pmx” file. A pmx file contains all the design data and design metadata to allow 
the application to be installed in another server instance.

<p>Tornado Server clearly separates the User Interface (UI) from the logic. This makes 
applications more robust and less prone to being broken when graphic designers make slight 
alterations to the UI.

<p>We recommend using the Puakma Vortex IDE for developing Tornado Server applications.
