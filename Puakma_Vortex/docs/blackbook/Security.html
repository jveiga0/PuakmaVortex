<body><h1>Advanced Authentication Options</h1>

<p>The Puakma server takes care of all security, leaving the developer free to perform the occasional 
role check. Authentication to the server is managed by one or more “Authenticators” which are 
configured in Puakma.config. Developers may write their own Authenticators and install them 
at the server level. All applications on the server use the same authentication chain. 

<p>The authentication chain is the list of Authenticators in a specific order used to log 
users in to the server. Puakma ships with the default authenticator which checks usernames 
and passwords against a relational database. Also on the http://www.puakma.net website there 
are some additional authenticators, such as LDAP. This means that if a legacy system such 
as Domino is used, the user information may be utilized. There is also code available to authenticate 
against Netware NDS.
