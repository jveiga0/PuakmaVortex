<body><h1>Puakma as a Service</h1>

<p>Most modern operating systems support the running of programs as a daemon. 
Puakma may be run as a service, consult your platform documentation or the 
http://www.puakma.net website for operating system specific service information.

<p>Multiple instances of the server may also be run on the same machine.

<h2>Problems with binding on port 80 on UNIX</h2>

<p>On UNIX operating system it is prohibited for normal users to bind service 
on TCP port which is lower than 1000. This port can be bound only by root user.
However running any service is not recommended, and it is considered as big
security danger. There has been many problems with running services under root
user in the past. This happened in services written in C language. The main problems 
were stack overflows, and further execution of code on stack. This is caused by bad 
buffer bounds checking. Java itself eliminates problems like this because it is 
principally impossible to run some data in JVM.
But JVM is written in C/C++, and it might contain some errors which might allow this 
kind of error.
So for security reasons it is better to run services under normal user with
restricted privileges to lower possible harm.

<p>However question how to bind to port 80 is still open. Some servers written in
C solves this problem, but as Tornado is written in Java, there is no standard
way how to solve it. There are some solutions how to go around this problem, at least
on Linux operating system.

<p>This generally means that you can run Tornado server as normal user, bind HTTP 
for example to port 8080. Then make modification to your firewall to redirect 
communication from port 80 to port 8080. Next section contains guide how to get
this done on Linux operating system with iptables firewall.

<p>Also note that problem with binding port lower than 1000 doesn't happen on Windows
operating system.
